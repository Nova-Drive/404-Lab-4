1. https://github.com/Nova-Drive/404-Lab-4/tree/main

2. A splash page saying the install worked successfully 

3. a. Shows a 404 error. b. Shows the text in polls/views.py

4. Makemigrations makes the scripts to change the database, Migrate runs the scripts. Needed to change the database schema

5. You see all of the models created and a folder called Authentication and Authorization.
To make more models you make more classes in models.py and register them

6. When inputting a number, you get the appropriate screens. If not you got an error message. I would modify to use a string instead of an integer in urls.py

7. URLs can be dynamic and may need to change

8. It's very easy to set them up, and Django also does a lot of stuff behind the scenes as well. If you need something very very specific its better to not use it.
